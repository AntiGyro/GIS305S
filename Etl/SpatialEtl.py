"""
This module contains the SpatialEtl superclass, which provides a high-level structure for the Extract, Transform,
and Load (ETL) process for spatial data. The SpatialEtl class has methods for extracting data from a remote source,
transforming it, and loading it into a specified destination. This class serves as a base class that can be extended
for specific use cases.
